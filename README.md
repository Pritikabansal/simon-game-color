<h1>Simon Says Game - </h1>
<p>The Simon Says game is a classic memory and pattern-recognition game that challenges players to recall and replicate sequences of colors. In this interactive game, a series of tones and corresponding lights flash in a specific order, starting with a single tone and becoming progressively more complex. Players must watch carefully, then repeat the sequence in the exact order it was presented.</p>
